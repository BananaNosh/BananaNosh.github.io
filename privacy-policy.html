<h2 id="m13">Legal Bases</h2>
<p>Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence. If more specific legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.</p>
<p>In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. This includes, in particular, the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – BDSG). The BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. It also regulates data processing for the purposes of employment relationships (§ 26 BDSG), especially with regard to the establishment, implementation, or termination of employment relationships and the consent of employees. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>
<h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
<p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs, the nature, scope, circumstances, and purposes of processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.</p>
<p>These measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access, input, disclosure, securing availability, and separation of the data. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data threats. We also take the protection of personal data into account when developing or selecting hardware, software, and procedures, in accordance with the principle of data protection by design and by default.</p>
<p>SSL encryption (https): To protect your data transmitted via our online offering, we use SSL encryption. You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in your browser's address bar.</p>
<h2 id="m12">Deletion of Data</h2>
<p>The data we process will be deleted in accordance with legal requirements as soon as their consents permitted for processing are revoked or other permissions cease to apply (e.g., if the purpose of processing this data no longer applies or it is not required for the purpose). If the data is not deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes, its processing will be restricted to these purposes. That is, the data will be blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons or whose storage is necessary for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.</p>
<p>Our privacy notices may also contain further information on the retention and deletion of data, which take priority for the respective processing operations.</p>
<h2 id="m15">Changes and Updates to the Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Please inform yourself regularly about the content of our privacy policy. We adapt the privacy policy as soon as the changes in the data processing we carry out make this necessary. We will inform you as soon as the changes require your cooperation (e.g., consent) or other individual notification.</p>
<p>If we provide addresses and contact information of companies and organizations in this privacy policy, please note that the addresses may change over time and ask you to check the information before contacting us.</p>
<h2 id="m10">Rights of Data Subjects</h2>

<ul><li><strong>Right to object: You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is based on Article 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. If personal data concerning you is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for such marketing; this also applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong> You have the right to withdraw consents given at any time.</li>
<li><strong>Right of access:</strong> You have the right to request confirmation as to whether data concerning you is being processed and to obtain information about this data as well as further information and a copy of the data in accordance with legal requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Right to rectification:</strong> You have the right, in accordance with the law, to request the completion of data concerning you or the rectification of inaccurate data concerning you.</li>

<li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> You have the right to receive data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format or to request its transmission to another controller, in accordance with the law.</li>
<li><strong>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority:</strong> You have the right, without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the provisions of the GDPR.</li></ul>
